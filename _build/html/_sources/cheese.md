Back to [Intro](intro.md).

## Nutrition

Cheese is also very nutrient dense. Here is a table of various kinds of cheese and their nutritional content.

| Type | Water | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:|
| Swiss | 37.1 | 26.9 | 27.8 | 5.4|
| Feta  | 55.2 | 14.2 | 21.3 | 4.1|
| Cheddar | 36.8 | 24.9| 33.1| 1.3|
| Mozzarella | 50 | 22.2 | 22.4 | 2.2|
| Cottage    | 80 | 11.1 | 4.3 | 3.4 |

```{table} Cheese Nutrition content

As you can see in the table {ref}'cheese-nutrition' swiss cheese has the highest protein content per 100g and cottage cheese has the lowest fat content per 100 g.
